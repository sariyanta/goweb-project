# Go Web Project

This project is an exercise of the [Building Modern Web Application with Go](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/) by [Trevor Sawler](https://github.com/tsawler). I've decided to build a somewhat different project from the course because I thought it would help me not to get into 'tutorial hell'. It also helps to better demonstrate my understanding and capabilities to build web application using Go.
